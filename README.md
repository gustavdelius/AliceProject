# MMath Extended Independent Project (in progress)

## Overview
In this project I propose a multispecies stock-recruitment model that directly incorporates the effects of species interactions at the community level. 
My project will be completed in the following stages:

1. Select data from a relevant group of species from a single ecosystem to use as a [case study](https://github.com/alicedwoodley/Extended-Independent-Project/edit/main/README.md#1---selecting-a-case-study).
2. Devise a series of differential equations that [model stock-recruitment processes](https://github.com/alicedwoodley/Extended-Independent-Project/edit/main/README.md#2---devising-the-model) of multiple species at the community level.
3. [Fit the devised model](https://github.com/alicedwoodley/Extended-Independent-Project/edit/main/README.md#3---fitting-the-model) to the chosen case study data.
4. [Evaluate the success](https://github.com/alicedwoodley/Extended-Independent-Project/edit/main/README.md#4---evaluating-success) of the model.

I will then produce a written report and additionally give a talk on the results of my work.

## Data
This project uses data from the RAM Legacy stock assessment database (<https://www.ramlegacy.org/>). The folder '[RAM Legacy raw data](https://github.com/alicedwoodley/Extended-Independent-Project/tree/main/RAM%20Legacy%20raw%20data)' contains both the Rdata file and script file describing the contents of the database. 

The file 'Gulf_Of_Alaska.RData' contains the processed data used for all following work. It contains two variables:
- GoA.species : common name, scientific name and RAM Legacy stock ID code for the 6 chosen species.
- GoA.data : spawning stock biomass (SSB) and recruitment time series for all 6 chosen species.

## Project stages and repository contents

### 0 - Initial research
The folder '[Initial research](https://github.com/alicedwoodley/Extended-Independent-Project/tree/main/Initial%20research)' contains workings through some of chapter 13 of '[Introductory Fisheries Analyses with R](https://derekogle.com/IFAR/)' by Derek Ogle. I made basic plots and fitted single-species stock-recruitment models, first for the Pacific Coast arrowtooth flounder and then for the North Sea European plaice.

### 1 - Selecting a [case study](https://github.com/alicedwoodley/Extended-Independent-Project/tree/main/Case%20study)
Here I search the database for a suitable 

### 2 - Devising the model
Stage 2 to be completed around 07/12/2025.

### 3 - Fitting the model
Stage 3 to be completed around 25/01/2026.

### 4 - Evaluating success
Stage 4 to be completed around 22/02/2026.

### Report and presentation
Report deadline 27/04/2026 and presentation day 08/05/2026.
